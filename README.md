# Step 1: Add Appylar to your Gradle
Set our jitpack artifact repository in your project's root build.gradle (or settings.gradle if you are using settings repositories):
```
[build.gradle (NameOfProject)]
...

allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```
Set dependency in your :app module's build.gradle:
```
[build.gradle (: app)]
...

dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.appylar:android-sdk:#latest-version'
}
```

# Step 2: Setup the Configuration for your App and Listeners
1. Create arbitrary subclass of Application(), override it's onCreate() and implement interface of Events. You can, of course, use your Application subclass if you already have one in your project.
#### Kotlin
```
[AppylarApplication.kt]

class AppylarApplication : Application(), Events {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
    }

}
```
- #### Java
```
[AppylarApplication.java]

public class AppylarApplication extends Application implements Events {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
    }
}
```
2. Add this new subclass to AndroidManifest.xml" inside <application> tag:
```
[AndroidManifest.xml]

<application
    android:name=".AppylarApplication"
    ...
```
3. Setup the Configuration for your app. Set up with your values ðŸ˜‰
